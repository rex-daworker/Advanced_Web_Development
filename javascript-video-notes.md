# Advanced Web Development Notes

## 1. Course Goal
The course aims to introduce modern web development tools and help understand what languages and technologies to focus on. It also includes an introduction to Microsoft developer tools.

## 2. What Is JavaScript?
JavaScript can run on the client (browser), server (Node.js), and even natively in some environments. It is mainly used to make web pages interactive.

## 3. Running JavaScript (Browser vs Server)
JavaScript in the browser handles UI interactions, while server‑side tasks like database access require Node.js.

## 5. Demo: Building My Toolbox
A walkthrough of setting up VS Code, installing extensions, and preparing a JavaScript development environment.

## 6. Creating the First Application
Introduction to writing and running the first JavaScript file.

## 7. Code Comments
Comments help document code without affecting execution.
* Single‑line: `//`
* Multi‑line: `/* ... */`

## 8. Commenting Shortcut (MacOS)
Using `Cmd + /` to toggle comments in VS Code.

## 9. Conditionals
The video explained `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements. It showed how JavaScript makes decisions based on conditions.

## 10. Functions
I learned how to define and call functions, and why they help organize code. Arrow functions were introduced as a modern alternative.

## 11. Scope
This video clarified the difference between global and local scope. It helped me understand why variable placement matters.

## 12. Arrays
I learned how arrays store ordered lists and how to access items using indexes. The examples made array manipulation intuitive.

## 13. Array Methods
Methods like `.push()`, `.pop()`, `.map()`, and `.filter()` were demonstrated. I found `.map()` and `.filter()` especially powerful.

## 14. Loops
The video covered `for`, `while`, and `for...of` loops. It helped me see how loops automate repetitive tasks.

## 15. Objects
I learned how objects store key‑value pairs and how to access properties. It made JavaScript feel more structured.

## 16. Object Methods
This video showed how functions can live inside objects as methods. It helped me understand how objects model real‑world behavior.

## 17. JSON
I learned that JSON is a lightweight data format used for APIs. It was helpful to see how to convert between JSON and JavaScript objects.

## 18. The DOM
The video introduced the Document Object Model and how JavaScript interacts with HTML. It made web interactivity feel more concrete.

## 19. Selecting Elements
I learned how to use `querySelector()` and `getElementById()` to access elements. This is essential for manipulating the page.

## 20. Changing the DOM
This video showed how to update text, styles, and attributes. It made me understand how dynamic websites are built.

## 21. Events
I learned how to respond to user actions like clicks and keypresses. Event listeners made the page feel interactive.

## 22. Event Objects
The event object gives extra information about what happened. It’s useful for handling more complex interactions.

## 23. Forms
This video explained how to capture user input from forms. It helped me understand how websites collect data.

## 24. Form Validation
I learned how to check if user input is correct before submitting. It’s important for user experience and security.

## 25. Template Literals
Template literals make string formatting easier using backticks. They make dynamic strings much more readable.

## 26. String Methods
I learned useful methods like `.slice()`, `.includes()`, and `.toUpperCase()`. These tools make text manipulation easier.

## 27. Math Object
The video introduced built‑in math functions like `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()`. These are great for games or calculations.

## 28. Date Object
I learned how JavaScript handles dates and times. It was interesting to see how to format and manipulate dates.

## 29. Error Handling
The video explained `try`, `catch`, and `finally`. It showed how to prevent apps from crashing unexpectedly.

## 30. Debugging
I learned how to use browser dev tools to inspect and debug code. It made troubleshooting feel less intimidating.

## 31. Strict Mode
Strict mode helps catch errors early by enforcing cleaner code. It encouraged me to write more reliable scripts.

## 32. Arrow Functions
This video explained the shorter syntax and lexical `this` behavior. It made modern JavaScript feel more elegant.

## 33. Higher‑Order Functions
I learned that functions can accept other functions as arguments. This concept is powerful for writing cleaner code.

## 34. Callback Functions
Callbacks help control the order of operations. It helped me understand asynchronous behavior better.

## 35. Promises
Promises make async code easier to manage. `.then()` and `.catch()` improve readability.

## 36. Async/Await
Async/await makes asynchronous code look synchronous. It felt much easier to understand than nested callbacks.

## 37. Fetch API
I learned how to make HTTP requests to APIs. It was exciting to see how JavaScript connects to external data.

## 38. Modules
Modules help split code into separate files. This makes larger projects more organized.

## 39. Classes
Classes provide a cleaner way to create objects and reuse code. It made JavaScript feel more like other OOP languages.

## 40. Inheritance
This video showed how classes can extend other classes. It helped me understand how to reuse and structure code.

## 41. Local Storage
I learned how to save data in the browser using `localStorage`. It’s useful for remembering user preferences.

## 42. Session Storage
Session storage works like local storage but resets when the tab closes. It’s great for temporary data.

## 43. Timers
`setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` allow delayed and repeated actions. They’re useful for animations or reminders.

## 44. Regular Expressions
I learned how regex helps match patterns in text. It looks complex but powerful for validation.

## 45. Spread and Rest Operators
These operators simplify working with arrays and function arguments. The spread operator felt especially intuitive.

## 46. Destructuring
Destructuring makes it easy to extract values from arrays and objects. It reduces repetitive code.

## 47. Map and Set
I learned how `Map` and `Set` store unique values and key‑value pairs. They offer advantages over plain objects and arrays.

## 48. Error Types
This video explained different JavaScript errors like syntax and reference errors. It helped me understand how to interpret error messages.

## 49. Hoisting
Hoisting moves declarations to the top of their scope. It clarified why some variables behave unexpectedly.

## 50. Closures
Closures allow inner functions to access outer variables. This concept is powerful for encapsulation.

## 51. Final Project / Wrap‑Up
The final video tied everything together with a small project. It helped me see how all the concepts connect in real development.
